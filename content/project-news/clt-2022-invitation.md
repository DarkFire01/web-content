ReactOS will participate with an own booth on [CLT 2022](https://chemnitzer.linux-tage.de/2022/en).
It will be held on this Saturday and Sunday.
Starts at 9:30 CET and ends at ~18:00 CET on both days.

The whole thing will be held online and to make you at least feel a bit like you are there in real they once more use the [WorkAdventure](https://workadventu.re/) platform.

We plan to show ReactOS of course and stuff that works.
We also plan a presentation on this Sunday at 2pm CET.
It will be held in English.
(Split up to a HEAVY German accent, a Spanish accent and an USA accent ^^)
Topic will be: "ReactOS. What is it? What it can do? What is in the works?"

This time we were asked if we wanna add our own map to the whole event and I thought... why not and made one.
There will be a teleporter on our booth while the event is up and running.
It's still not finished, but you can see the first almost done draft here:

If you find problems: Tell me.  
If you have some ideas for the empty spots: Tell me.  
And as important: If you find good videos to embed... Tell me!
