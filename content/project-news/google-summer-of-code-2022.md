We are proud to announce that ReactOS has been accepted into the 2022 Google Summer of Code program.

The GSOC program is a great opportunity for a fresh contributors looking to join the Open Source and Free Software movement.

This year we are looking for new contributors who want to enhance skills in kernel development and NT architecture.
Our team consists of skilled mentors who are going to guide eager students with ReactOS architecture and development practices.

Check out a fresh [list of ideas](https://reactos.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code_2022_Ideas) for this Summer of Code. This year it consists of two types of projects - 175 and 350 hour ones. Pick whatever you prefer. Of course, contributors are by no means restricted to the proposals already listed and invited to submit their own suggestions.

There is also an important change to GSoC rules this year - now candidates are not required to be university students.

Candidates are advised to join our chat on [Mattermost](https://chat.reactos.org) or #talk:reactos.org room on Matrix network and talk about possible projects for this GSoC.

Good luck to anyone submitting and we look forward to hearing from you and hopefully working with you in the near future!
